It is also purging the Pentagon to eradicate all vestiges of such programs.AdvertisementAdvertisement\u201cEveryone sees on the news where the Trump admin stands; you don\u2019t want to do anything that shoots yourself in the foot,\" one official said.\"Green technologies\u201d have allegedly been replaced with \u201cinnovative technologies,\u201d while \u201cclimate\u201d has been labeled an \u201coperational environment,\u201d another NATO official said.

So far they've been left unscathed.Trump has announced that Europe needs to end its \u201cfreeloading\u201d on the U.S. and start paying more for defense. He has also pushed to increase the alliance's defense spending target to 5 percent of GDP from the current goal of at least 2 percent \u2014 but at the same time has undermined the alliance's common defense provisions by threatening to abandon allies he thinks aren't spending enough on their militaries.On Tuesday the administration proposed cutting funding to the State Department by 48 percent, which would affect funding for NATO's internal budget, the United Nations and 20 other international organizations.AdvertisementAdvertisementRelated TagsClimate changeClimate diplomacyDefense budgetsDepartmentEnvironmentGender equalityMilitaryNATOSecurityWarRelated CountriesUnited StatesRelated PeopleDonald TrumpRelated OrganizationsNATOUnited NationsOur readers read nextObituaryThe complex legacy of Pope Francis3 HRS ago 7 mins readFormer Pentagon official warns department\u2019s dysfunction could topple Hegseth9 HRS ago 4 mins readFrom Across the PondTrump may get a nuclear deal \u2014 on Iran\u2019s terms10 HRS ago 6 mins readIsraeli military says review into its killing of Gaza aid workers found \u2018professional failures\u201920 HRS ago 2 mins readMore from Antoaneta RoussiUkraine allies hold talks to secure a non-existent peaceThe coalition of the willing will start laying out potential contributions in writing.Apr 103 mins readRutte smiles and Rubio flees as NATO survives a summitNATO\u2019s boss insisted that the alliance \u201cremains the cornerstone of European security,\u201d despite worries about Trump.Apr 44 mins readUK regrets \u2018return to protectionism\u2019 as Trump\u2019s tariffs spark trade warForeign Secretary David Lammy says Britain \u201cbelieves in open trade\u201d \u2014 and refuses to rule out retaliatory tariffs.
