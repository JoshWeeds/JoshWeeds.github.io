    <p class="stopAtHalf" id="pleft"><strong><u>History</u></strong><br>Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as “Spurs”, was formed in 1882 by a group of schoolboys. Spurs have a rich history and a deep connection with the Jewish community, a bond which is reflected in the nickname “Yid” used by Spurs supporters, a term originally used in a derogatory manner by rival fans but now adopted as a self-designation by Spurs supporters. The club experienced a golden era in the 1960s, notably winning the League and FA Cup Double in the 1960-61 season. A significant milestone came in 2019 when Spurs reached the UEFA Champions League final, however they lost 2-0 to Liverpool. Under the leadership of current manager Ange Postecoglou and captain Heung-Min Son, the club has seen a recent resurgence, despite not having won a trophy since their League Cup victory in 2008. The club continues to strive for success, embodying the spirit of its supporters and their fervent ties to the club and its history.</p>
